# Project Structure Overview

##  Application.kt
- Registers Kotlin with Jackson.
- Initializes JDBI for PostgreSQL and sets up DAOs.
- Registers REST resources:
  - `AttendanceResource`
  - `EmployeeResource`
- The `main` function calls `run()` to launch the Dropwizard application using the YAML config.

---

##  EmployeeConfiguration.kt
- Maps values from `config.yml` to Kotlin properties using Jackson annotations.
- Contains a nested `DatabaseConfig` class with:
  - `url`, `user`, and `password` ‚Äì required for DB connection.

---

##  config.yml
- Defines server ports:
  - Application: `9090`
  - Admin: `8081`
- Sets logging levels.
- Configures database connection:
  - `user`, `password`, and `url` (with timezone settings).

---

##  EmployeeManager.kt
Acts as a bridge between the **resource layer (REST API)** and the **data layer (DAOs)**.

Contains business logic to:
- Add/delete employees.
- Check-in and check-out attendance.
- Fetch working hours between date ranges.
- Validate employee IDs.
- Fetch currently checked-in employees.

---

##  EmployeeDAO.kt
Handles database operations for the `employees` table.

Functions include:
- Inserting new employees.
- Fetching all employees or a specific one by ID.
- Deleting an employee by ID.

Uses **JDBI** for SQL operations.

---

##  AttendanceDAO.kt
Handles all attendance-related database operations.

Functions include:
- Inserting check-ins.
- Updating records with check-outs.
- Fetching all attendance records.
- Finding active (not yet checked-out) records.
- Deleting attendance by employee ID.
- Finding latest active attendance for an employee.
- Fetching records between date ranges for reporting.
